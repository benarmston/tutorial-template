Welcome to Hub Sphinx / RTD documentation!
==========================================

This is a test Sphinx (aka Read the docs) repo to test with Flight Hub.  There is still much to do with it.

* [ ] Use github app to download the repo.  Currently, we rely on the repo being publicly available so that we can `git clone ...` it.
* [ ] Pickup on changes to the git repo automatically (see git app above) and recompile the docs.
* [ ] Create Flight Hub theme for sphinx; mandate its use; or override the specified theme.
* [ ] Integrate the built HTML into the hub layout.  Currently; its entirely separate.
* [ ] Support markdown in this description.
